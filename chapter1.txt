Chapter1

This is the chapter1 of my first novel.
The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, 
a Yale University graduate from the Midwest 
who moves to New York after World War I to pursue 
a career in bonds. He recounts the events of 
the summer he spent in the East two years later, 
reconstructing his story through a series of 
flashbacks not always told in chronological order.
In the spring of 1922, Nick takes a house in the 
fictional village of West Egg on Long Island, where 
he finds himself living among the colossal mansions 
of the newly rich. Across the water in the more 
refined village of East Egg live his cousin Daisy
and her brutish, absurdly wealthy husband Tom Buchanan.
