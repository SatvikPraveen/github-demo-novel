This is the chapter1 of my first novel.
The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, 
a Yale University graduate from the Midwest 
who moves to New York after World War I to pursue 
a career in bonds. He recounts the events of 
the summer he spent in the East two years later, 
reconstructing his story through a series of 
flashbacks not always told in chronological order.
