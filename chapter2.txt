===========
Early in the summer Nick goes over to their house for dinner,
where he also meets Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy’s and a
well-known golf champion, who tells him that Tom has a mistress
in New York City. In a private conversation, Daisy confesses 
to Nick that she has been unhappy. Returning to his house in 
West Egg, he catches sight of his neighbour, Jay catsby, 
standing alone in the dark and stretching his arms out to 
a green light burning across the bay at the end of Tom and Daisy’s dock.
